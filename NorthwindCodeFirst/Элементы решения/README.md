# NorthwindCodeFirst

### This project demonstrates the use of Entity Framework Core with the Code-First approach for a SQL Server database.
### It creates tables for Categories, Products, Orders, and Order Details with a structure closely mirroring the original Northwind database.
### The application automatically generates the database schema, serving as a template for building more complex data management systems.
